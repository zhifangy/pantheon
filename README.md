# Pantheon

Pantheon is a series of functions and workflows aimed to facilitate analyzing fMRI data. It
provides a unified api to access and manipulate data in a custom layout. It also includes workflows
to create HCP-like data (e.g., functional dtseries data in fsLR 32k space) from fMRIPrep outputs.

This project is created to meet my own data analysis requirement and preference. It may not
reflect the best practices. But it will constantly evolve with my latest thoughts.

## Getting Started

This project mostly relies on python packages. But several common neuroimaging tools are also
required to complete certain operations.
